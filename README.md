- **QuickStart** folder contains the server side ASP.NET Core solution and configured to work with Visual Studio.
- **QuickStartUI** folder contains the Angular UI application which is configured to work with the angular-cli.

### Merging Client and Server Solutions
Client and Server solutions are designed to work separately by default.


## Deploy Database 

#### Connection String
Open appsettings.json in QuickStart project and change the Default connection string if you want:

    ```json
    {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
        "sqlConnection": "server=.; database=QuickStartDb; Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true"
      },
    }
    ```

### Migrations

Use Entity Framework Core's built-in tools for migrations. Open Package Manager Console in Visual Studio, set QuickStart as the Default Project and run the Update-Database command as shown below:

This command will create your database. Initial data will be inserted when you run the QuickStart project. You can open SQL Server Management Studio to check if database is created:

You can use EF console commands for development and Migrator.exe for production. But notice that; Migrator.exe supports running migrations in multiple databases at once, which can be useful in development/production for multi tenant applications.

### Run API Host
Once you've done the configuration, you can run the application. Server side application only contains APIs. When you start the application you will see a login page like below:
