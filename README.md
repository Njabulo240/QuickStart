- **QuickStart** folder contains the server side ASP.NET Core solution and configured to work with Visual Studio.
- **QuickStartUI** folder contains the Angular UI application which is configured to work with the angular-cli.

### Merging Client and Server Solutions
Client and Server solutions are designed to work separately by default.


## Deploy Database 
To deploy the database, follow these steps:

## Open the Solution
1. Navigate to the **QuickStart** folder.
2. Locate the solution file.
3. Open the solution file, which will automatically launch Visual Studio.

### Configure Connection String
1. In the **QuickStart** project, open `appsettings.json`.
2. Modify the default connection string if necessary:

    ```json
    {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
        "sqlConnection": "server=.; database=QuickStartDb; Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true"
      },
    }
    ```

### Apply Migrations
The application uses the Code First approach of Entity Framework Core. All migration code is located in the **QuickStart/Migrations** folder.

1. Open the **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio.
2. Set **QuickStart** as the default project.
3. Run the following command to update the database:

    ```powershell
    Update-Database
    ```

This will apply the migrations and set up your database. 

After running the migrations, your database tables will be created as shown below:

### Run API Host

Once you've configured the application, you can run the server-side application. The server-side application contains only APIs. The API is running on [https://localhost:5001](https://localhost:5001). Paste this URL into your browser to access the application and you will see the login page below:

## Hosting Angular App Inside ASP.NET API

To merge and host the Angular application inside the ASP.NET Core API, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Angular Application**:
    - Navigate to the `QuickStartUI` folder.
    - Run `ng build` to build the Angular application. This will create a `dist` folder containing the compiled Angular files.

2. **Move Built Files to ASP.NET Core Project**:
    - Copy the contents of the `dist` folder.
    - Paste these contents into a new folder named `wwwroot` inside the `QuickStart/QuickStart/wwwroot` folder. The `wwwroot` folder is the default location for static files in an ASP.NET Core application.

3. **Configure ASP.NET Core to Serve Angular App**:
    - Open the `Program.cs` file in the `QuickStart` folder.
    - Ensure that the `Configure` method is set up to serve static files and handle fallback routing for the Angular application:
    
    ```csharp
        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

        app.UseRouting();
        app.MapFallbackToController("Index", "Fallback");

    ```

4. **Run the Combined Solution**:
    - Open the `QuickStart` solution in Visual Studio.
    - Run the solution. The ASP.NET Core API should now serve the Angular application.

By following these steps, you will successfully host the Angular application inside the ASP.NET Core API, creating a unified solution.
